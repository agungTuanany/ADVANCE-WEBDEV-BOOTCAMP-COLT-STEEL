# === OBJECTIVE ===
    1. Join data to d3 selection using the data method.
    2. Target nodes to append to the DOM via the enter selection.
    3. Target nodes to remove the DOM via the exit selection.
    4. Perform more advance data joins by using a key function.
    5. Update existing DOM elements with new data.
    6. Merge update and enter selection, and descrine D3's general update pattern.

## Basic Data Joins and Enter Selections

##### callback Structure

    function (d, i) {
              ^  ^
              ^  Index of the current element in the selection
    Data bound to the current element

    }

when we pass the callback function in D3 method the first parameter in the
callback function is always refer to "data-bound" to the current element by D3.
By convention the argument is typically we call " _d_ " for data, should need the
index piece of data in the array of data is made for you available as the second
argument in the callback

##### Enter() and Exit() method from D3

Using D3's _enter_ and _exit_ selections method, you can create new nodes for
incoming data and remove outgoing nodes that are no longer needed. in here we
learn using 'enter()' method.

e.g

    d3.select("quotes")
        .style("list-style", "none")
      .selectAll("li")
      .data(quotes)
      .enter()          << bound data to a selection.
      .append("li")
        .text(d => `" d.quote" _ d.movie (d.year) `);

## Exit Selection and Key Function

we learn how to remove element from the DOM, when those elements not bound to
data.


##### exit() method
we can use D3 to select the element to remove it, but then our page will out
 of sync with the data since the quote array still have the quote init. The
 common approach is let the data is single quote of true and then update the
 view

We want to remove  the quote of 'Finding Nemo'. Since the 'Finding Nemo' is the
last array we can call 'pop' to remove it.

    quotes.pop()

    >> Object { quote: "Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Swimming, swimming,
    swiming.", movie: "Finding Nemo", year: 2003, rating: "G" }" }

This will remove 'Finding Nemo' quotes from the data site but we still see it on
the page. Next we need update the data binding to tell D3 to remove any list item
have no longer corresponding of piece of data.

Take a look what happen when we update the data binding

    d3.selectAll("li")
      .data(quotes)

    >> Object { _groups: (1) […], _parents: (1) […], _enter: (1) […], _exit: (1) […] }

    // the complete syntax.
    d3.selectAll("li")
      .data(quotes)
      .exit()
      .remove()

Instead removing the last quote, we want to remove "R" quotes that came from
array of movies

    var nonRQuotes = quotes.filter(function(movie) {
      return movie.rating !== "R"
    });

    nonRQuotes;

    >> (3) […]
        0: {…}
          movie: "The Sixth Sense"
          quote: "I see dead people."
          rating: "PG-13"  << This we filter the data
          year: 1999
        <prototype>: Object { …  }
        1: {…}
          movie: "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"
          quote: "May the force be with you."
          rating: "PG"    << This we filter the data
          year: 1977
        <prototype>: Object { …  }
        2: {…}
          movie: "Finding Nemo"
          quote: "Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Swimming, swimming, swiming."
          rating: "G"     << This we filter the data
          year: 2003
        <prototype>: Object { …  }
        length: 3

Now we bind this "li" and then remove the extra elements

    d3.selectAll("li")
      .data(nonRQuotes)
      .exit()
      .remove();

There is a problem we didn't actually remove the two "R" quotes from the DOM. We
just remove the last two list item from unordered list.

Interestingly if we select all of the "li" and call ".data" in our selection we
can see the data is correct, there are no "R" quote here.

    d3.selectAll("li")
      .data();

    >> (3) […]
      0: Object { quote: "I see dead people.", movie: "The Sixth Sense", year:
        1999, …  }
      1: Object { quote: "May the force be with you.", movie: "Star Wars: Episode
        IV - A New Hope", year: 1977, …  }
      2: Object { quote: "Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Swimming,
        swimming, swiming.", movie: "Finding Nemo", year: 2003, … }
    length: 3
    <prototype>: Array []" }

So what went wrong? The issue here has to do how data to get bounds element in
D3. By default data is join on the element is by index.

![image-1](/Basic-data-Joins-and-Enter-Selection/images/pic-1.jpg)

* the first elements in the non "R" quotes array is match of first list item
* the second elements in the non "R" quotes array is match to the second list item and so on.

This mean is the first three elements on page get match with the three quotes
and the last two list items get move to the exit selection since no data left
over for them. But the last element on the page have a quote that we want to keep.

There's two ways to fix this problems.

One is restyle the elements after we join the new data using the same code we
get before.

    var colors = {
      "G": "#3cff00",
      "PG": "#f9ff00",
      "PG-13": "#ff9000",
      "R": "#ff0000"
    };

    d3.selectAll("li")
      .text(d => '"' + d.quote + '"_ ' + d.movie + '(' + d.year + ')')
      .style("margin", "20px")
      .style("padding", "20px")
      .style("font-size", d => d.quote.length < 25 ? "2em" : "1em")
      .style("background-color", d => colors[d.rating])
      .style("border-radius", "8px")

Essentially we encounter this problem because D3 didn't know should be removing
list item base on the content of the quotes. Which is neither there three quotes
left and so remove the last two elements. But we joint data the element, however
we can also specify D3 should match data and element together.

The second approach is we using 'keyFunction'. We do this by passing which call
a *Key Function* in as the second parameter to the ".data" method. The return
value from 'keyFunction' is then what use to match data rather then default
behavior matching by index.


##### Key Function

    selection.data(dataArr [,keyFunction])
                              ^
              Return value used to join elements and data

The second approach :

    var nonRQuotes = quotes.filter(function(movie) {
      return movie.rating !== "R";
    });

    d3.selesctAll("li")
      .data(nonRQuotes, function(d) {
        return d.quote;
      })
      .exit()
      .remove();

![image-2](/Basic-data-Joins-and-Enter-Selection/images/pic-2.jpg)

In this case *Key Function* tells D3 that the first elements in the quotes array
should be match whatever list item corresponds that quotes and so on for the
second and the third quotes. When data is bound this way the two list items
without any data will be precisely the list item containing outrated quotes.


## General Update Pattern

When you appending a new element on an update, make sure you select the parent
element you like to append to before selecting the children, otherwise by
default your new element will be appended to the HTML tag.

    d3.selectAll("li")  << this the issue
      .data(quotes)
      .enter()
      .append("li")
        .text()

In this case we need update our initial selection so that were first selecting
the unordered list before creating the selection of list item.

    d3.select("quotes")   << add parent element
      .selectAll("li")
      .enter()
      .append("li")
        .text();

Note: any changes you make to selection will only affect the new list item, this
because we pass in to the enter selection.

##### Selection Types

![Selection Types](/General-Update-Pattern/images/D3-selection.jpg)

    * Enter selection: correspond pieces of data that don't yet have element on the page

    * Exit selection: correspond the element on the page that no longer have pieces of data

    * Update selection: correspond the element on the page that successfully join the data

This separation between **Enter** and **Update** selection can be helpful if we
want to style one group differently then the other. But what if we want to apply
the same of changes above selection? We could just grab each group individually
and apply the changes we want. D3 provides a method called **Merge()**

##### Merging Selection

    selection.merge(otherSelection)

Merges _**selection**_ and _**otherSelection**_ together into a new selection

e.g:

Let's apply our existing style rules to the _**newQuotes**_ but after merging lets
changes the font-color every quotes on the pages.

First we binding existing **listItem** to our new data and storing the
selection. Since we haven't call enter() or exit() this represent the **Update**
selection.

    var listItems = d3.select("#quotes")
      .selectAll("li")
      .data(quotes);

Next happing (take place) to **Enter** selection appending the new listItems and styling them
appropriately

    ListItems
      .enter()
      .append("li")
        .text()
        .style("background-color", d => colors[d.rating])
        .style("border-radius", "8px")
      .merge(listItems)    << this is why we store the Update selection into a variable
        .style("color", "#5599ff");

We updating the style at every listItems in that selection not just the new one.

##### 4 steps General Update Pattern

1. Grab the update selection, make any changes unique to that selection, and
   store the selection in a variable.
2. Grab the exit selection and remove any unnecessary elements.
3. Grab the enter selection and make any changes unique to that selection
4. Merge the enter and update selections, and make any changes that you want to
   be shared across both selections.

## Exercise & Solution Character Frequencies

I Make a function _**getFrequencies**_ that calculate frequencies that given input
a string. This function return array of object where each objects store the
character and it's counts as values.

    function getFrequencies(str){

    }

The reason that why I want this structure is, that will be convenient to pass
this array into D3's data method to joint the array to elements.

Implementing this function doesn't require any D3 knowledge it's pure
JavaScript. How you implement this function depends how you want order the
characters. I like them to appear alphabetically in my visualisation. So I'm
going to split this string and sort the resulting array.

    var sorted = str.split("").sort();

Next I create an empty array to store my eventual output.

    var data = [];

And write for-loop over my sorted array to build-up my data array. You can also
build this with "reduce", but lets keep this thing simple for now.

    for (var i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {

    }

Since my array is sorted I know that any repeating character will appear
consecutive position. This is helpful for figuring out the counts for each
character. First I grab the last element in the array.

    var last = data[data.length - 1];

If there is last element and if that element character property matches the
current character than I know I found the character I seen before then I can
increment the count.

    if (last && last.character === sorted[i]) last.count++;

If I just starting out or I have seen the new character, then I can push a new
object into my new array which character property is current character and is
count is one.

    else data.push ({ character: sorted[i], count: 1 })

I'll never push  two object with the same property into the array because I'm looping over a sorted
array, so any duplicate will be caught by "if-condition".

Full function will be:

    function getFrequencies(str) {
        var sorted = str.split("").sort();
        var data = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {
            var last = data[data.length - 1];
            if (last && last.character === sorted[i]) last.count++;
            else data.push({ character: sorted[i], count: 1  });
      }
        return data;
    }

    getFrequencies("Hello!, World");

    >> 10) […]
          0: Object { character: " ", count: 1  }
          1: Object { character: "!", count: 1  }
          2: Object { character: ",", count: 1  }
          3: Object { character: "H", count: 1  }
          4: Object { character: "W", count: 1  }
          5: Object { character: "d", count: 1  }
          6: Object { character: "e", count: 1  }
          7: Object { character: "l", count: 3  }
          8: Object { character: "o", count: 2  }
          9: Object { character: "r", count: 1  }
          length: 10
          <prototype>: Array []

Let's start with D3.

I'll start with the "form" submission. I'll made to use D3 to listen the submit
event on the form. Inside the callback I first call a "**preventDefault()**" on the
event object which I access via **d3.event()**. Next I start the input as
**d3.selection()** and I grab this value use D3 "**proprety()**" method.

    d3.select("form")
        .on("submit", function() {
          d3.event.preventDefault();
          var input = d3.select("input");
          var text = input.property("value");
          ......
          ......
        });

At this point there are view things I need todo. First I make to create a enter
selection point and depends some 'div' to the page so that I can see the
frequencies for each character. I'll also need to update the text inside the
freeze 'div'. I leave the count 'div' alone for now.

To drop visualization with D3, let me select "#letters" container then select
all element inside all of it with the class of "letter". This will give me empty
selection that I can then join data() to. Inside **data()** method I'll use
getFrequencies() and pass the text from the form.


    d3.select("letters")
      .selectAll(".letter")
      .data(getFrequencies(text))

Then I'll hub the **enter** selection, **append** the 'div' for each piece of
data and add the class of "letter", I also add some my own style. Each time
I given characters appears on the screen I add "20px" of high. I also add the
inner text so that we can see the characters.

      .enter()
      .append("div")
        .classed("letter", true)
        .style("width", "20px")
        .style("line-height", "20px")
        .style("margin-right", "5px")
        .style("height", function(d) {
          return d.count * 20 + "20px";
        })
        .text(function(d) {
          return d.character;
        })

Finally for the 'div' with an id of "**#phrase**" I'll set the inner text of it base
on the text from the form

    d3.select("#phrase")
        .text("Analysis of: " + text);


Full of code will be :

    d3.select("form")
        .on("submit", function() {
          d3.event.preventDefault();
          var input = d3.select("input");
          var text = input.property("value");

          d3.select("letters")
            .selectAll(".letter")
            .data(getFrequencies(text))
            .enter()
            .append("div")
              .classed("letter", true)
              .style("width", "20px")
              .style("line-height", "20px")
              .style("margin-right", "5px")
              .style("height", function(d) {
                return d.count * 20 + "20px";
              })
              .text(function(d) {
                return d.character;
              })

          d3.select("phrase")
              .text("Analysis of: " + text);
        });

Our form works the first time we submit it, but not on subsequent tries, to get
form working on multiple submission we need to use the general update pattern.
To get those working I store update selection in variable.

    var letters = d3.select("#letters")
                    .selectAll("letter")
                    .data(getFrequencies(text));

For the update selection I want to make sure no element has class of new since
element in update selection already exists on the page. So I'll use the class
method to remove the new class and then I pop in selection and remove any
'div' that don't need to be there.

    letters
        .classed("new", false)
        .exit()
        .remove();

Next I move to the enter selection. In addition to adding a class of letters
I also want to add a class of new to the new elements so the inner text is style
a bit differently. The res of the style changes I can move to the **merge**
enter and **update** selection since they should apply above.

    letters
      .enter()
      .append("div")
        .classed("letter", true)
        .classed("new", true)
      .merge(letters)
        .style("width", "20px")
        .style("line-height", "20px")
        .style("margin-right", "5px")
        .style("height", function(d) {
          return d.count * 20 + "20px";
        })
        .text(function(d) {
          return d.character;
        })

Let me use this opportunity to update "**#count**" 'div', when the form
submitted the number of new letters will be equal the number of nodes on the
enter selection.

    d3.select("#count")
      .text("(New characters: " + letters.enter().nodes().length + ")");

So the rest code will be :

    d3.select("form")
        .on("submit", function() {
          d3.event.preventDefault();
          var input = d3.select("input");
          var text = input.property("value");

          var letters = d3.select("letters")
                          .selectAll(".letter")
                          .data(getFrequencies(text));

          letters
              .classed("new", false)
              .exit()
              .remove();

          letters
            .enter()
            .append("div")
              .classed("letter", true)
              .classed("new", true)
            .merge(letters)
              .style("width", "20px")
              .style("line-height", "20px")
              .style("margin-right", "5px")
              .style("height", function(d) {
                return d.count * 20 + "20px";
              })
              .text(function(d) {
                return d.character;
              })

          d3.select("phrase")
              .text("Analysis of: " + text);

          d3.select("#count")
            .text("(New characters: " + letters.enter().nodes().length + ")");

          input.property("value", "");
        });


So we have encounter a problem that the second phrase isn't count the new
letters. The problem is **how we join a data**. We didn't pass a key function so by
default D3 join by index. If the second phrase have one or more unique
characters then the first, how to make D3 understand that the second letters
include a new characters? We can fix this by joining **base on characters**
rather then in **index**.

    var letters = d3.select("#letters")
        .selectAll("letter")
        .data(getFrequencies(text), function(d) { << this solve the problem
          return d.character;
      });

Let finish this things up by tackling a reset button. Compare to the form
submission this is much more straight forward. I target the button and listen
for the 'click' inside of the callback I just need to select a class of
  **letter** remove that selection and clear out the text inside the **#phrase**
  and **#count** 'div'.

    d3.select("#reset")
      .on("click", function() {
          d3.selectAll(".letter")
            .remove();

          d3.select("#phrase")
            .text("");

          d3.select("#count")
            .text("");
      })
