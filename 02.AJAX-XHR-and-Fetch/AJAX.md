======== WHATS THE DEAL WITH JSON and XML =======

they both a "data format"

Data formats : 
    API don't responds with HTML. API's responds with pure data, not structure.

    so they use more efficent data format like XML and JSON

    API is exists to share information between computer or between code.


    XML :

    Extended Markup Language. more specific from HTML

    //eg in pinteres

    <pin>
    <title>     </title>
    <author>    </author>
    <num-saves> </num-saves>
    </pin> 


    so much easy to parse the data with JSON. today
